// WeftHeddle.kt — Jetpack Compose Heddle binding for Weft
//
// WHY EXISTS: Implements the Compose draw-phase deferred read pattern and
// ViewModel-scoped Steward binding per WHITEPAPER §8.1 and DIRECTIVE-12 T12.3.
//
// DISPOSAL ORDERING:
// The Heddle is remembered and tied to the ViewModel lifecycle. On recomposition,
// the Heddle instance is preserved (survives recomposition); disposal occurs
// strictly when the enclosing scope exits via DisposableEffect or ViewModel onCleared.

 *
 * Disposal implements the [ReattachPolicy] semantics declared at construction
 * (previously the enum existed but dispose() ignored it):
 *
 *  - [ReattachPolicy.PRESERVE_HELD] — the Weft stays bound to the ViewModel-
 *    scoped Steward; re-entering the composition re-binds to the same channel
 *    and the last claimed frame is still held (default; survives navigation).
 *  - [ReattachPolicy.RESET_ON_ATTACH] — the channel is kept but the next
 *    claim() after re-attach re-renders from whatever is freshest at that
 *    moment; no writer-side action on dispose (the producer keeps running).
 *  - [ReattachPolicy.REVOKE_AND_RENEW] — the Weft is revoked and released
 *    back to the Steward on dispose (I6 ordering: revoke BEFORE the reference
 *    is dropped, so a late publish is a DROPPED_REVOKED no-op, never a write
 *    into a channel nobody owns). Re-entering the composition allocates a
 *    fresh channel.
