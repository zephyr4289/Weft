// FrameCursor.kt — per-reader freshness telemetry (driver layer)
//
// WHY EXISTS: RFC-0008. The Triad Protocol drops intermediate frames by
// design (latest-wins IS the semantics of display) — but "dropped" was
// invisible to the reader. The kernel envelope already carries the fix:
// `seq` increments once per publish, so any reader can compute exactly how
// many frames were published between its own claims and never seen:
//
//     framesBehind = seq_now - seq_prev - 1
//
// ZERO kernel changes: no second atomic, no protocol version bump (the
// kernel surface stays frozen — 02 §2.2). The reader diffs its own claimed
// envelope seqs. Draw code can use this as a control signal: adapt detail
// level (LOD), skip decorative work, or flag degradation when it happens.
//
// STATUS: SOURCE-ONLY, PENDING REAL-DEVICE VERIFICATION.
